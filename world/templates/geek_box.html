      <p>Personalized reports are driven by data modeled by the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. Geographic data sets of Oregon include: expected shaking, tsunami zone, soil liquefaction PGD, landslide PGD and impact zones determined by the Oregon Resilience Report. All data sets are created with best estimates around the Cascadia quake. The descriptions of risk and how to prepare for those risks are written based off best estimates from DOGAMI, OSSPAC, The Red Cross and FEMA. It’s impossible to be perfectly prepared for a natural disaster, but Aftershock tries to deliver the most accurate information in an efficient way to make Oregonians more prepared in the case of the Cascadia earthquake. Data used for Aftershock is available for download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qefxqdddeqtlryq/AftershockDatabase.zip?dl=0">here</a>.</p>
