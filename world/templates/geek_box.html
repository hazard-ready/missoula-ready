      <p>Aftershock is designed to help Oregonians prepare for the pending Cascadia earthquake. It’s impossible to perfectly predict the outcome of a natural disaster.  However, several state agencies have released predictions on how a 9.0 earthquake from the Cascadia fault line would affect Oregon. Aftershock aims to organize and deliver that information in a way that makes it accessible any Oregonian.</p>
      <p>Aftershock uses data modeled by the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. Geographic data sets include: expected shaking, tsunami zone, soil liquefaction, landslides and impact zones ¬– determined by the Oregon Resilience Report. The descriptions of risk and how to prepare for those risks are based on best estimates from DOGAMI, Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission, The Red Cross and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Data used for Aftershock is available for download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qefxqdddeqtlryq/AftershockDatabase.zip?dl=0">here</a>.

      <p>Aftershock began during a weekend Storytelling with Data build-a-thon hosted by  <a href="http://www.hackoregon.org/">Hack Oregon</a> and the <a href="http://agora.uoregon.edu/">Agora Journalism Center</a> at the University of Oregon. Oregon Public Broadcasting’s Jason Bernert and Tony Schick led the project with contributions from Dan Logan of Portland State University, Geoff Ostrove of the University of Oregon, the Portland multimedia studio <a href="http://sticky.tv/">Sticky</a> and computer engineer David Losada.</p>
