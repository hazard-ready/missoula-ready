      <p>Aftershock is designed to help Oregonians prepare for a Cascadia earthquake. Several state agencies have released predictions on how a 9.0 earthquake from the Cascadia Subduction Zone would affect Oregon. Aftershock organizes and delivers that information in a way that makes it accessible to any Oregonian.</p>
      <p>Aftershock uses data from modelling done by the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. Geographic data sets include: expected shaking, tsunami zone, soil liquefaction, landslides and impact zones — determined by the Oregon Resilience Report. The descriptions of risk and how to prepare for those risks are based on best estimates from DOGAMI, the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission, the American Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Data used for Aftershock is available for download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qefxqdddeqtlryq/AftershockDatabase.zip?dl=0">here</a>.

      <h6 class="caps">Who made this?</h6>
      <p>Aftershock began during a weekend Storytelling with Data build-a-thon hosted by <a href="http://www.hackoregon.org/">Hack Oregon</a> and the <a href="http://agora.uoregon.edu/">Agora Journalism Center</a> at the University of Oregon. Oregon Public Broadcasting’s Jason Bernert and Tony Schick led the project with contributions from Dan Logan of Portland State University, Geoff Ostrove of the University of Oregon, the Portland multimedia studio <a href="http://sticky.tv/">Sticky</a> and computer engineer David Losada.</p>

      <h6 class="caps">Is this available for other states?</h6>
      <p>The data used in Aftershock was generated by state agencies in Oregon. Thus, the same data does not exist for Washington or California.</p>
