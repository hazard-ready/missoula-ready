### Deploying to the web via Docker
This repository has a Dockerfile that lets you build a Docker image of the Django app. It needs you to have `DATABASE_URL` and `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` set in your environment, but it is also able to guess sensible defaults for these values.

Do `docker build . --tag missoula-ready` and you can run it. It will set up the Python environment for you. Depending on the state of the database you're connecting to, you will likely need to start at the `python manage.py migrate` step under "Load some data".

For an example of a working production environment, see the `docker-compose.yml` in the [base repository](https://github.com/hazard-ready/disaster-preparedness)
