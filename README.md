# Earthquake Preparedness Web Interactive

The project will explore traditional and qualitative scoring assessments of “risk/resiliency   factors” associated with regional crisis preparedness and demonstrate how actionable steps in community engagement can create a different portrait of resiliency. Stories will engage examples of communities in distinct regions across Oregon facing knowable challenges in the event of a major earthquake.
